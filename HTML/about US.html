        <p>Coding, also known as computer programming, is the process of creating instructions for a computer to follow, using a
        specific programming language. These instructions are written in a code that computers can understand and execute,
        allowing them to perform various tasks. Essentially, coding is about translating human instructions into a form a
        machine can use.</p>
