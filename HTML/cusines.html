<p>
    Chicken curry or curry/curried chicken is a South Asian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is common in
    the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and South Africa. A typical curry from
    the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger, garlic,
    tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and
    cardamom. Outside of South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.
