    <h1>Honey Bee</h1>
    <h2>Here's all the buzz about honeybees</h2>
    <p>The <strong>domestic honeybee</strong> (<em>Apis mellifera</em>), also frequently spelled "honey bee" and known scientifically as the European or western honeybee, is the most common of the nine species of honey-producing bees. It is native to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.</p>
    <p><strong>Beekeeping</strong>, or apiculture, is the human management of honey bee colonies. The practice dates back to almost 9,000 years ago, according to a 2015 paper published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. Modern beekeepers use human-made bee hives that are typically boxes with rows of wooden frames that bees fill with wax honeycomb. The hives are designed to give beekeepers access to collect honey and help maintain the nest.</p>
    <h2>Why honeybees are important</h2>
    <p> Honeybees produce several products that are useful to people, notably honey and beeswax.</p>
    <p>There is a saying among beekeepers: "With a bee, you can use everything but the buzz," said Sue Garing, a commercial beekeeper who owns and operates a honey business in Kirkwood, New York.</p>
